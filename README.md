# Mastermind

A simple command-line implementation of the Mastermind game in C++.

## How to Play

- The computer generates a secret code consisting of 4 numbers (colors), each between 1 and 6.
- You have 10 guesses to crack the code.
- After each guess, youâ€™ll be told:
  - How many numbers are correct and in the correct position.
  - How many numbers are correct but in the wrong position.
- Optionally, you can enable "cheat mode" to reveal the secret code at the start.
