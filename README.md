# Mastermind

A customizable command-line implementation of the Mastermind game in C++.

## How to Play

- The computer generates a secret code consisting of numbers (default: 4 digits, each between 1 and 10).
- You can set the code length, the range of digits, and the maximum number of attempts at the start.
- After each guess, youâ€™ll be told:
  - How many numbers are correct and in the correct position.
  - How many numbers are correct but in the wrong position.
- Optionally, you can enable "cheat mode" to reveal the secret code at the start.
